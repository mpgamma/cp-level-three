# Level Three

Level Three is a mod for [Crystal Project](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637730/Crystal_Project/), named after the level you start at (and end at, in this mod).

It sets battle rewards to zero (XP, LXP, and money) and rearranges the entire game to create an interesting chain of progression. It is exploration-focused with only a bit of combat.

*This mod should be considered beta. While extensively tested by the author, it has not yet been played by anyone else. It may still need some bugfixes or balancing.*

## How to Play

### Downloading the Mod

If you play Crystal Project with Steam, you can get Level Three from the workshop.

If you play on something else, you can download the mod's JSON from this repository. Click `level3.json` above, and use the download button in the top right (two buttons to the right of "Raw" at the time of writing). Save it to your game's mod directory.

Where is that directory? I'm not sure, and it might depend on how you installed the game. You can probably find the answer on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VGeS8aTBj3). If you have answers, I welcome contributions to this document.

### Playing the Mod

Start a new game, press the Mod button (indicated in the bottom right), select just Level Three, and start the game as usual. The current version is **0.1**, if you want to verify you have the latest before starting.

From there, everything you need to know is in the game. This document also contains an overview, if you want to know more before trying.

Level Three's balance is incredibly delicate both in and out of battle, and so it expects a **fresh new game without carryovers or other mods**. Not even cosmetic mods, since most dialog is rewritten and includes some important hints. If you ignore that advice and ruin things, it's on you.

The only potential exception is if you want to see what happens if you break the constraint the mod is named after. It won't take long.

## Overview

The main change in Level Three is to set battle rewards to zero (XP, LXP, and money).

The focus is on creating an interesting progression chain. You will enter many locations from unusual directions. You will perform tricky jumps and juke flames without access to the mounts you normally have in that region. You will dodge around many bosses and get their rewards without a fight. You will usually die a quick death if any flame catches you.

Combat plays a small role. While almost all flames are meant to be avoided, there are occasionally required battles. These enemies are mostly unaltered despite being intended for higher levels, so they are very challenging and require clever setups to defeat. If this sounds intimidating or unappealing, you can use the new assists to skip all combat.

A lot of effort has been put into quality-of-life. There are over a dozen extra home points, even more added shortcuts, a hint system, and new assists to skip the most punishing segments. You can think of many of these as compensation for how mount-starved you will be and how much failing to dodge one flame will set you back.

### Difficulty

Level Three is harder than the base game if you use no assists, and maybe a little easier if you use most of them. If you go for the Proof of Merit, the difficulty increases tremendously.

About the in-game difficulty setting, Level Three was tested against Hard. The choice of in-game difficulty doesn't have much effect since there's not a lot of combat, and bosses will flatten you on any mode if you come unprepared. The real determiner of difficulty is how many assists you allow yourself to use.

## Q&A

### I'm a newer Crystal Project player. Is this mod for me?

Yes. I would encourage you to finish Crystal Project and find all the crystals and major areas first, since this mod sometimes assumes knowledge about where many of these things are.

On Level Three, you may need to use many of the assists, but there should still be a lot you can enjoy and find interesting or mindbending.

As an example of why this mod may be for you, Level Three requires following the zero-crystal routes to the capital and desert. If you don't know them, Level Three will teach you. At the point when you are required to take these routes, ask Nan for a hint, and she will enable a squirrel guide. The squirrel take you through the route and show which jumps you have to make. Or you can ask Nan for an assist and receive a warp stone to skip it altogether.

### I'm a Crystal Project expert. Is this mod for me?

Yes. The mod contains a Proof of Merit sidequest that spans the entire adventure. Not using the new assists is the least of its requirements. Even the most experienced player would likely feel very challenged while tackling it.

The sidequest can be permanently failed. If you intend to try it, tell Nan to disable assists right away, and listen carefully to all the rules once you reach the capital.

### How long is Level Three?

Substantially shorter than the base game, since you won't spend much time in battles, you (should) know the general world layout, and the scope of content is otherwise similar. But I don't yet know where and how people will get stuck, so I could be off.

### How much combat is there?

You spend almost all of the game dodging every flame you see. There are about a dozen required fights. The majority are very close to the end when you have the best equipment and three or four Master Materials.

The combat is typically very challenging, especially early without LXP or any Master Materials. If the difficulty is overwhelming you, there are assists available. In many cases, you can skip individual fights. Or, if you're burnt out on battles, you can join the Boomer Society (also an assist) and borrow their overpowered weapons. These skip nearly all the combat and flame-dodging.

### Is this like a randomizer seed?

Sort of. The item, equipment, class, and boss locations have been rearranged in the style of a randomizer while leaving most locations of chests, crystals, and flames unchanged.

Still, many liberties have been taken compared to what Crystal Project's randomizer might give you. The mod should feel like something new more often than it feels like a hand-crafted randomizer seed.

Of note is that boss locations are shuffled and quest item drops have been added and subtracted. Most bosses are death traps that you're always expected to lose against. Someone in the world will hint any boss you need to defeat, and Nan will also tell you if you get stuck and ask her for help.

### What's with this weird status on some bosses?

There is a simple and ludicrously boring strategy to guarantee victory in most battles, even at level three. The new status blocks that strategy. The mod gives that status to most high-level bosses.

I tried to design the status to not intrude on less boring approaches to combat, but I do not yet know if I succeeded.

I'm also not a combat guru. There may be other strategies that deserve to be similarly addressed, but I only found this one.

### How glitch-aware is the mod?

Not very. I know about the owl super jump and Slip Glide Ride ramp climb. Neither should significantly break the intended progression. But other glitches might.
